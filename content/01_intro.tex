    \item [\iref{https://pypi.org/project/pip/}{pip}] The standard package installer for Python. \texttt{pip} is able to install
      directly from PyPI and other indexes.
    \item [\iref{https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{mamba}] Fast and robust, with cross-platform support. Written in \cpp.
      Allows you to manage multiple, isolated environments. \texttt{mamba} installs from local or remote package repositories, \eg, channels.
    \item [\iref{https://python-poetry.org/}{poetry}] Package installer that is also able to create its own virtual environments.
      Handles dependency resolving better than pip. Works nicely with \texttt{pyproject.toml} files. Allows the use of lock files.
    \item [\iref{https://docs.astral.sh/uv/}{uv}] A new and fast package manager written in {\footnotesize{\faRust}}\,\texttt{Rust}. Can create
      virtual environments, and solves dependencies better and faster than pip. Allows the use of lock files.
